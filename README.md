# in_house_codes_for_SAXS
To share codes developed by Kim et al.

OS: These codes run in most linuxOS (including Ubuntu 16.04) and MacOS (including version 10.13.6)

No non-standard hardware (such as GPU, TPU) is required.

Please see a relevant paper for detail (will be updated once the paper is finally accepted, currently it is under revision)

All source codes run with Python.

For example, python xxx.py

Each source code has how-to-run explanation and working example files (expected run time for demo on a "normal" mackbook pro laptop is less than 1 minute).

Some codes require PHENIX pre-installation (please see how-to-run explanation, typical PHENIX installation takes ~5 minutes on a "normal" macbook pro laptop).

To reproduce our results, please contact us so that we can send raw files.
